Text Summarization using Refine-Type Chain Technique

Overview

This project implements a text summarization technique using a refine-type chain approach. Unlike traditional machine learning models, this method does not rely on pre-trained NLP models. Instead, it incrementally refines the summary as it processes the text, ensuring a coherent and concise final output.

Features

No dependency on external machine learning models.

Processes text in paragraph format.

Uses a structured approach to refine and improve the summary iteratively.

Simple and lightweight implementation.

Installation

Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed before running the notebook. You can install them using:
pip install langchain
